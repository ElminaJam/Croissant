    <p>
      In 1839, an Austrian named August Zang, opened a bakery in Paris, called
      La Boulangerie Viennoise selling pastries including the Kipferl. Due to
      its popularity, French bakers reinvented the pasty, using yeast calling it
      a croissant, meaning crescent in French. In 1915, the first recipe of a
      croissant was written by French Baker Sylvain Claudius Goy.
